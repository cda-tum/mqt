# Open-Source Implementations

All tools that have been developed as part of the _MQT_ are publicly available on [github.com/cda-tum](https://github.com/cda-tum).
Many of these tools are powered by MQT Core, which forms the backbone of the entire toolkit.
It features a comprehensive intermediate representation for quantum computations as well as a state-of-the-art decision diagram package for quantum computing and a dedicated ZX-calculus library.

All tools have been mainly implemented in C++, but strive to be as user-friendly as possible for the community.
Hence, push-button solutions are provided through Python bindings, pre-built Python wheels are available for all major platforms and Python versions, and all tools integrate natively with IBM's Qiskit.
All tools are actively maintained and well documented.
