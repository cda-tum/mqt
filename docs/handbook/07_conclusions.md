# Conclusions

Design automation tools and software have been crucial for the development of classical circuits and systems.
They enable faster and more reliable design cycles, reduce human errors, and allow for complex and large-scale designs.
In the domain of quantum computing, the corresponding design automation methods (which have been developed over the past decades) remain heavily underutilized.
The _Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_ makes substantial contributions towards leveraging this latent potential.
For many important design tasks, several methods and tools have been proposed that explicitly use design automation expertise while, at the same time, considering characteristics of quantum computing.

Overall, the _MQT_ demonstrates the immense benefits of leveraging existing knowledge and expertise in classical circuit and system design for the development of quantum software.
By applying design automation methods to various tasks, the MQT significantly advances the state of the art in quantum computing and improves the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of quantum software solutions.
In the absence of appropriate tools and software, the potential of quantum computers may remain untapped despite their immense computational capabilities.
The _MQT_ highlights the importance of design automation methods in shaping the future of quantum computing.
As the quantum computing landscape advances towards fully fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), the _MQT_ aims to support researchers, developers, and practitioners in the near-, middle-, and far-term future by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and methods.
