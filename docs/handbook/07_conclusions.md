# Conclusions

Design automation tools and software have been crucial for the development of classical circuits and systems.
They enable faster and more reliable design cycles, reduce human errors, and allow for complex and large-scale designs.
In the domain of quantum computing, the corresponding design automation methods (which have been developed over the past decades) remain heavily underutilized.
The _Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_ makes substantial contributions towards leveraging this latent potential.
For many important design tasks, several methods and tools have been proposed that explicitly use design automation expertise while, at the same time, considering characteristics of quantum computing.
As the quantum computing landscape advances towards _Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing_ (FTQC), the _MQT_ aims to support researchers, developers, and practitioners in the near-, middle-, and far-term future by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and methods.

The Munich Quantum Toolkit has been supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the ERC Consolidator Grant (agreement No. 101001318), the NeQST Grant (agreement No. 101080086) and MILLENION (agreement No. 101114305).
It is part of the Munich Quantum Valley, which is supported by the Bavarian state government with funds from the Hightech Agenda Bayern Plus, and has been supported by the BMWK on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag through project QuaST, as well as by the BMK, BMDW, the State of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET program, and the QuantumReady project within Quantum Austria (managed by the FFG).
